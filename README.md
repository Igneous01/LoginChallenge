#Welcome to Company.inc

Thank you for helping us set up Company Inc's login system. Please implement all backend code in a language of your choice, and use a relational database (MySQL or equivalent) to store the user records.

###Tasks
Here's a list of tasks we have outstanding for Company Inc's login system organized by page.

####Login
We need this page hooked up for a user to login to our system. This should be the page they see when they are logged out of Company Inc.

####Signup
This page allows for a user to sign up for an account with Company Inc. They can create their login credentials and then use these login credentials on the login page to successfully sign into Company Inc.

####Status
This is our main dashboard where all the great things happen for our customers. Only users with a valid login should be able to access this page. The user's name should be replaced in the welcome message. The user should also be able to logout and once logged out the user will be presented with the login page.
